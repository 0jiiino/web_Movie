  <p>I like all the Harry Potter series, but I like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone the most. I think it is the most meaningful movie that helped me enter Harry Potter.</p><br><br>

  <p>I love Harry Potter. Among the three main characters, I like   <strong>'Ron Weasley'</strong> the most. He's so cute!</p><br>
  <img src="Hermione.png">
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">The second character to introduce is <strong>'Hermione'</strong>. She  has very attractive curly hair and is smarter than anyone else. I can't talk  about Harry Potter without her.</p><br>
  <img src="Harry.jpg">
  <p>Finally, the long-awaited star! It's <strong>'Harry Potter'</strong>. He's had a lot of trouble   since he was a kid, but he's overcome it well. Harry, the hero of the magical   world, is a wonderful character.</p><br>
